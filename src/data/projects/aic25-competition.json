    "description": "Led team SIU Cerberus at Ho Chi Minh City AI Challenge 2025, deploying the TARS (Temporal Alignment Retrieval System) framework for order-aware video event retrieval. Achieved 93.15% accuracy on the benchmark with a training-free monotonic DP alignment approach.",
    "details": [
        "Designed and led implementation of TARS: a training-free, order-aware video retrieval system decomposing queries into ordered sub-event sequences.",
        "Monotonic dynamic-programming alignment enforcing strict temporal ordering at inference time with O(nm) time and O(m) memory complexity.",
        "Complementary vision-language encoders reducing sensitivity to individual encoder weaknesses across diverse query types.",
        "Two-stage retrieve-then-rerank pipeline: FAISS coarse retrieval followed by TARS re-ranking for precision-latency balance."
