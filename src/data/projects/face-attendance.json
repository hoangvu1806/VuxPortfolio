    "description": "A modular kiosk-based face recognition system for attendance and access control, featuring facial alignment, quality gating, and anti-spoofing mechanisms for near real-time biometric verification.",
    "details": [
        "Modular Vision Pipeline: Integrates face detection, 2D similarity transform alignment, and identity matching into a unified flow.",
        "Quality Gate System: Automatically filters frames affected by blur, low contrast, or poor lighting to maintain high embedding accuracy.",
        "Anti-Spoofing Mechanism: Implements verification layers to detect printed or digital attack attempts in various lighting conditions.",
        "High Performance: Optimized to run on limited hardware with a latency of 1-2 seconds from subject detection to result.",
        "Robust Data Processing: Standardizes input via similarity transforms, significantly reducing intra-class variation for stable recognition."
